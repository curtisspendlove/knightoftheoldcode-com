One of my favorite things to do is mentor new developers.

I'm currently distilling the information I've learned doing so into a series of books.

The first is a crash course on self-promotion (I know, it's a dirty word; but it's neccessary). We'll explore how to sell yourself in a comfortable way to give you an edge over your competitors (others seeking the same jobs you're applying for). We'll also work together on a simple, but functional website using free tools. (That's right, you can get yourself a corner of the internet that sings your praises for free. And with a pretty minimal cost, we'll personalize it even more with your own domain name and a few other perks.)
